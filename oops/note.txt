method - function inside a class

methodName(){

}

properties - variables inside a class

constructor - is used to initialize the properties.

class className{
      // property
    // constructor
    // methods
}

It is not mandatory to include property, constructor, method inside a class.

It is optional.

instance variable - this keyword is used 

constructor is a mathod. It is self invoking method when object is created.


pillers of oops
---------------

1)inheritance

   used to access methods and properties from one class to another class.
   parent class - class from which methods and properties are accessed.
   child class  - class which access methods and properties from other class

   extends keyword is used to access methods and properties.

   two types of inheritance

   1) classical inheritance
      
      extends keyword is used to access methods and properties.

   2) object inheritance

      __proto__ 

      multi level inheritance
      -----------------------

2)polymorphism
  
  poly - many

  morphism - forms

  1) method overloading
     
     method with same method but with different arguments.
     
     execute based on the number of arguments.

     javascript does not support method overloading.

     rest operator is used to achieve polymorphism - (...)

  2) method overriding
     
     function with same name and same arguments.

     javascript support method overriding.

3)encapsulation
4)abstraction


exception handling
------------------

exception - run time errors.

try-catch block is used to handle exception

try - statements which can commit errors are placed.

catch - how to behave or resolve the error. 

finally - statements that have to be executed in both cases (try and catch).
